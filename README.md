An Android App for keeping track of garments. A user shall be able to create entries for garments and to associate them via closet and outfit relationships. Garments shall be identified in five main ways; by garment type--either a preconstructed type or a user defined type--by a set of colors, a set of patterns, a set of materials and by placement (eg torso, legs, full body etc).   Additionally, garments  have an associated image.  Outfits may be a set of user selected garments and accessories, or they may be generated according to user defined criteria. 
Garments and associated data, as well as closets and outfits shall be stored in an onboard SQlite database.

Database design
===============

Outfit:
-------
This table is a collection of <outfitid, outfitname> pairs, which represent an entry in a record of distinct outfits.   
* Primary Key (OutfitID): integer NOT NULL Auto_Increment  
primary key OutfitID is auto generated by SQLite database and incremented as user adds new outfits to the database; this is what associates the outfit with a collection of garments/accessories  
* Outfit_name: varchar(255) NOT NULL  
String identification for outfit, created by user upon outfit creation  


Outfit_has_garment:
------------------
This table is a collection of <entrynum, outfitid, garmentid> tuples, which represent an entry in a record of distinct outfit, garmentid pairs. The entrynum primary key allows a particular outfit to associate with multiple garments.  
* Garment_num (Primary Key): integer NOT NULL Auto_Increment  
Integer identification of distinct outfit,garment entry  
* OutfitID (Foreign Key): integer  
references Outfit.OutfitID  
represents the outfit in the “outfit_has_garment” relationship  
* GarmentID (Foreign Key): integer  
references Garment.GarmentID  
represents the garment in the “outfit_has_garment” relationship  

Closet:
------
This table is a collection of <closetid, userid, closetname> tuples, which represent an entry in a record of distinct closets. A single closet can only be associated with one user.

- Outfit_num (Primary Key):  integer Auto_Increment	 
Integer identification of distinct closet,outfit entry   
- OutfitID (Foreign Key):  
references Outfit.OutfitID  
represents the outfit in the “closet_has_outfit” relationship  
- ClosetID (Foreign Key):  
references Closet.ClosetID  
references the closet in the “closet_has_outfit” relationship  

Closet_has_garments:
-------------------
This table is a collection of <entrynum, closetid, garmentid> tuples, which represent an entry in a record of distinct closetid, garmentid pairs. The entrynum primary key allows a particular closet to associate with multiple garments.  
- Garment_num (Primary Key): integer Auto_Increment  
Integer identification of distinct closet, garment entry  
- GarmentID (Foreign Key):  
references Garment.GarmentID  
represents the garment in the “closet_has_garments” relationship  
- ClosetID (Foreign Key):  
references Closet.ClosetID  
represents closet in the “closet_has_garments” relationship  

Garment:
--------

- GarmentID (Primary Key): integer NOT NULL Auto_Increment  
integer identification of distinct garment  
- PlacmentID (Foreign Key): varchar(255) NOT NULL  
references Placement.PlacementID  
represents the user selected placement option for this garment  
- Imagepath: varchar(255)  
string path to image file chosen by user upon creation  

Tag:

-TagID (Primary Key): integer NOT NULL Auto_Increment  
integer identification of distinct tag  
-Tagname: varchar(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE   
string name of tag  
-TagType (Foreign Key): varchar(255) NOT NULL  
references TagType.typename

-Typename (Primary Key): varchar(255) NOT NULL  
string name of tag type  

Garment_has_Tag:  
---------------  
This table is a collection of <tagnum, tagid, garmentid> tuples which represent an entry in a record of distinct   tagid,garmentid pairs. The tagenum primary key allows a particular garment to associate with multiple tags.  
-Tagnum (Primary Key): integer NOT NULL Auto_Increment  
integer identification of distinct tagid, garmentid pair  
-TagID (Foriegn Key): integer  
references Tag.TagID
